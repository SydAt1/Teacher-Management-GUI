The project comprises 3 existing classes - "Teacher", "Lecturer", and "Tutor" - along with
a new class - "Teacher GUI" - which stores the details of teachers in an ArrayList. The
project facilitates the addition of details of lecturers and tutors, storing them in the
ArrayList while also ensuring that there is no duplication of data by looping and checking
the values. The project also allows grading of assignments and setting the salary of tutors
by comparing the new data with the existing data.
